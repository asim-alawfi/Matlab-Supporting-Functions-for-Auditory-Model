# Matlab-Supporting-functions-for-Auditory-Model

This repository contains MATLAB scripts required for the auditory model bifurcation analysis. **You do not need to run these scripts directly**. They only need to be added to the MATLAB path when performing the bifurcation analysis for the auditory model using **DDE-Biftool** . To set up the repository correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Create a folder** named **`Supporting_function`**, and inside it, create a subfolder named **`Supporting_functions`**. 
2. **Download** all the provided MATLAB scripts in this repository, and place all the downloaded scripts in the subfolder **`Supporting_functions`**.
   
   ⚠️ **Note:** The folder name **`Supporting_function`**, and the subfolder name **`Supporting_functions`** must be used exactly as written. MATLAB requires this specific folder path to be added to the search path for the auditory model bifurcation analysis to function correctly (see the README in the repository *Matlab-Scripts-Auditory-Model-Part1*).
