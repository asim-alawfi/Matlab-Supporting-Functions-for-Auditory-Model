# Matlab-Supporting-functions-for-Auditory-Model


### Important Note:

This repository contains MATLAB scripts that are required for the auditory model bifurcation analysis. In order to use these scripts correctly, please follow these steps:

1. **Download** all the provided MATLAB scripts.
2. **Create a subfolder** within your working directory and name it **`Supporting_functions`**.
3. **Place all the downloaded scripts** into the newly created `Supporting_functions` folder.
   
   ⚠️ **Note:** It is essential to use this exact folder name (`Supporting_functions`) because MATLAB requires this folder path to be properly added to the search path for the auditory model bifurcation analysis to work correctly.
