# Matlab-Supporting-functions-for-Auditory-Model

This repository contains MATLAB scripts required for the auditory model bifurcation analysis. **You do not need to run these scripts directly**. They only need to be added to the MATLAB path when performing the bifurcation analysis for the auditory model using **DDE-Biftool** (see the README in the repository *Matlab-Scripts-Auditory-Model-Part1*). To set up the repository correctly, please follow these steps:

1. **Download** all the provided MATLAB scripts.
2. **Create a folder** named **`Supporting_function`**, and inside it, create a subfolder named **`Supporting_functions`**. Place all the downloaded scripts in this subfolder.
   
   ⚠️ **Note:** The folder name **`Supporting_functions`** must be used exactly as written. MATLAB requires this specific folder path to be added to the search path for the auditory model bifurcation analysis to function correctly.
